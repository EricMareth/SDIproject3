<p>I am changing up the story for this assignment since getting too creative last time adversely affected my grade.</p>
<p>Since trying to stick to a flowchart and programming to it's parameters seems a little robotic to me, I thought the tale should be about a couple of droids.</p>
<p>But don't worry, I will try to have as much fun with it as possible.</p>
