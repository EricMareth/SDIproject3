<p>I am changing up the story for this assignment, and I am going with a type of parody.</p>
<p>Since trying to stick to a flowchart and programming to it's parameters seems a little robotic to me, I thought the tale should be about a couple of droids.</p>
<p>It is a robotic parody of Samuel Beckett's "Waiting For Godot", which I call "Waiting for '3PO". Though the story may seem to lack substance or imagination, it has a similar structure to Beckett's opus.</p>
<p>But don't worry, I will try to have as much fun with it as possible.</p>
